// For example, if you had a complex data structure returned by an API
// that was used in multiple places, you might define its type here.

// Currently, no global types are strictly necessary for this application
// as component props and service function signatures handle type definitions locally.
// Keeping it for scalability.

export {}; // Ensures this file is treated as a module.
